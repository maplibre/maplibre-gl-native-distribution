[MapLibre Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native) is a community-led fork derived from [mapbox-gl-native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native) before their switch to a non-OSS license. The fork also includes Maps SDK for iOS and macOS (forked from [mapbox-gl-native-ios](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios)) and Android SDK (forked from [mapbox-gl-native-android](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-android)).

## Add MapLibre to your Project

To add a package dependency to your Xcode project, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency and enter its repository URL. See [Adding Package Dependencies to Your App.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app)

## Swift Packages Development

You can override the MapLibre package dependency and edit its content by adding it as a local package.  See [Editing a Package Dependency as a Local Package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/editing_a_package_dependency_as_a_local_package).

For example, you can add this to `Package.swift`, if you are interested in testing the Mapbox framework with another framework.

```swift
products: [
    .library( name: "Mapbox", targets: ["Mapbox"]),
    .library( name: "MetalANGLE", targets: ["MetalANGLE"])
],
dependencies: [ ],
// target path should be relative to package root
targets: [
    .binaryTarget(name: "Mapbox", path: "Mapbox.xcframework"),
    .binaryTarget(name: "MetalANGLE", path: "MetalANGLE.xcframework")
]
```

## Test MapLibre with a Swift Playgrounds

When you download this repo there is a Swift Playground that allows you to change the style and play around with a very simple rendered map.  

* Download this repo
* Navigate to the folder where you `clone`d, and open `Package.swift` in at least Xcode 12.
* Run Playground by choosing `Editor` > `Run Playground` or `⇧-⌘-⏎`
* See issue [maplibre-gl-native-distribution#8](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native-distribution/issues/8) for screenshots of the MapLibre for Swift Playgrounds in action.

## Local Development Guide

### Building and Using Local Framework

1. Clone the maplibre-native repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native.git
```

2. Build the framework using our build script:
```bash
MAPLIBRE_DIR="/path/to/maplibre-native" ./scripts/build_maplibre.sh
```

This script will:
- Build the framework using Bazel
- Move the built framework to this repository
- Configure your environment to use the local framework

### Switching Between Local and Remote Framework

- To use local framework: `export USE_MAPLIBRE_LOCAL_FRAMEWORK=1`
- To use remote framework: `unset USE_MAPLIBRE_LOCAL_FRAMEWORK`

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure your Bazel build succeeds in maplibre-native
2. Check that the framework was copied to the correct location
3. Verify your environment variable is set correctly with `echo $USE_MAPLIBRE_LOCAL_FRAMEWORK`
